# Specification of file formats used by AviaNZ

AviaNZ annotations and filter definitions are stored in JSON format to allow easy parsing and manual inspection by text editors.

## Annotation files (.data)
A JSON array where the first (optional, but recommended) element stores metadata about the corresponding audio file, and each remaining element corresponds to a segment:

    [ Meta, seg, seg, seg, seg ... ]

`Meta`: a JSON object (key-value pairs) containing any metadata. Required fields:  
`Operator` - string  
`Reviewer` - string  
`Duration` - numeric, audio file length, in seconds  
...

Each true segment `seg` is a JSON array containing five elements, all required:

    [ starttime, endtime, freq.low, freq.high, labels ]
    
`startime, endtime` - segment start and end positions, in seconds, relative to start of file as 0.  
`freq.low, freq.high` - for annotation boxes, frequency band in Hz. For segments (full-band annotations), both `0`. If both `0<freq<1`, old format is assumed, and treated as full-band segment (`0,0`).  
`labels` - a JSON array of labels for each type of sound detected:

    [ label, label, label... ]
    
where each `label` is a JSON object, having some of the following fields:

    { "species": "Kiwi (Little spotted)", "certainty": 0, "filter": "kiwi-best", "calltype": "f1", ... }
    
`species` - string, either `"genus (species)"` or just plain `"species"`. May be `"Don't Know"` or any other label (`"Bellbird/Tui"`, `"Fantail (spp)"`...), except for the internal genus separator `>`. Required.  
`certainty` - numeric between 0 and 100. Currently, for `"species": "Don't Know"` only `0` allowed, `100` corresponds to green segments, and `50` corresponds to question marks in earlier formats. `(species, certainty)` defines a unique key for labels. Required.  
`filter` - string, name of the filter file that created this label, or `"M"` for manual annotations.  
`calltype` - string, to identify the call type. Call types can be annotated manually, or will be automatically generated from clusters during filter training. Required for automatic filters (i.e. if `filter` is not empty or `"M"`).  
Any additional attributes defined for this call (male/female, subjective loudness...) are optional and can be passed as key-value pairs.

Thus, a full .data file may look like this:

    [ {"Operator": Alice, "Reviewer": Bob, "Duration": 60.0, "Noise": "windy"},    // metadata
      // a manually marked box
      [1.0, 19.0, 1200, 2500,
        [
          { "species": "Kiwi (Little spotted)", "certainty": 100, "filter": "M", "loudness": 3 }
        ]
      ],
      // box from a "trill" filter
      [21.0, 23.0, 800, 6000,
        [
          { "species": "Morepork", "certainty": 50, "filter": "ruru-90-10", "calltype": "trill" }
        ]
      ],
      // a manually marked segment with morepork and something else
      [35, 45, 0, 0,
        [
          { "species": "Morepork", "certainty": 100, "filter": "M" },
          { "species": "Don't Know", "certainty": 0, "filter": "M" }
        ]
      ]
    ]


## Filter files (.txt)

A JSON array:

    { "species": "Kiwi (Little spotted)", "SampleRate": 16000, "Filters": [], "CNN": {}, ...}
    
Main filter ID is the file name because this automatically ensures that no duplicate IDs are present at any installation of AviaNZ. This name can be any string permitted by the OS, and no further information is gathered from it.  
`species` - string. This label will be assigned as the `species` in segments generated by this filter. Can follow `"genus (species)"` format as described above. Required.  
`SampleRate` - integer. All analyses will be done after down-(up-)sampling to this rate. Required.
Any extra parameters to be applied for all subfilters may be provided (such as `"wind"`).

`Filters` - JSON array of filters corresponding to each type of call (at least one element). Each is a JSON object:

    { "calltype": "clust1", "TimeRange": [min call length, max call length, avg syllable length, max gap between syllables], "WaveletParams": {"thr": 0.5, "M": 1.5, "nodes": [35, 37, 40]}, "FreqRange": [1000, 3000], ... }
    
`calltype` - either user-defined call type, or automatically generated cluster ID. String. Required.  
`TimeRange` - JSON array of length 4: `[minlen, maxlen, avgsyl, maxgap]`, respectively min and max lengths of a call, average syllable length, and maximum gap between parts of same call. Required.
`WaveletParams` - JSON object of parameters needed for wavelet filtering. Required. Currently needs:
`thr` - numeric, threshold for detecting calls. Required.  
`M` - numeric, energy curve window in seconds. Required.  
`nodes` - JSON array of wavelet nodes used in this filter. Required.  
`FreqRange` - frequency band for analysis. Identified calls will be marked as boxes with these limits, or as full-band segments if not provided.
Any extra subfilter parameters may follow, such as `"F0"`.

`CNN` - JSON object. Meta information about the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model for this species:

    "CNN": {"CNN_name": "Kiwi (Nth Is Brown)", "loss": "binary_crossentropy", "optimizer": "adam", "win": 0.25, "inputdim": [128, 30], "output": {"0": "Male", "1": "Female", "2": "Noise"}}

`CNN_name` - File name of the model, e.g. `Kiwi (Nth Is Brown).json` and `Kiwi (Nth Is Brown).h5`. Required.
`loss` - loss function. Required.
`optimizer` - optimisation algorithm. Required.
`win` - input image width in seconds. Required.
`inputdim` - input dimension in pixels. Required.
`output` - the output classes/labels. Required.
`windowInc` - window width and increment. Required.
`thr`- threshold for each call type. Required.

Thus, a full filter file may look like this:

    { "species": "Kiwi (Little spotted)", "SampleRate": 16000, "Rain": false, "Wind": true,
      "Filters": [
        { "calltype": "M", "TimeRange": [5, 60, 1, 3], "WaveletParams": {"nodes": [44, 45, 46], "thr": 0.5, "M": 1.5}, "F0": true, "FreqRange": [1500, 5000] },
        { "calltype": "F", "TimeRange": [10.0, 30.0, 0.8, 1.0], "WaveletParams": {"nodes": [41, 44], "thr": 0.8, "M": 2}, "FreqRange": [1000, 2500] }
      ],
      "CNN": {"CNN_name": "Kiwi (Little spotted)", "loss": "binary_crossentropy", "optimizer": "adam", "win": 0.25, "inputdim": [128, 30], "output": {"0": "M", "1": "F", "2": "Noise", "3": "Silence"}, "windowInc":[256, 128], "thr":[0.5, 0.3]}
    }

## CNN files (.JSON/.h5/.hdf5)

A CNN model has two files: model architecture is stored in a JSON file and the weights are stored in a Hierarchical Data Format 5 file (.h5 or .hdf5).
All the CNN models are stored in the user configdir/Filters and referred in the corresponding Filter files.

## Correction files (.corrections/ .corrections_species)

All Species Review mode generates .corrections:

A JSON array where the first element stores metadata, and each remaining element corresponds to a segment changed by reviewer:

    [ Meta, [seg, newlabel], [seg, newlabel], [seg, newlabel] ... ]

`Meta`: a JSON object (key-value pairs) containing any metadata, same as in .data.
`seg`: Each segment seg is a JSON array containing five elements, same as in .data.
`newlabel`: New label/s assigned to the segment by the reviewer.

Single Species Review mode generates .corrections_species:

A JSON array where the first element stores metadata, and each remaining element corresponds to a segment deleted by reviewer:

    [ Meta, seg, seg, seg ... ]

`Meta`: a JSON object (key-value pairs) containing any metadata, same as in .data.
`seg`: Each segment seg is a JSON array containing five elements, same as in .data.
