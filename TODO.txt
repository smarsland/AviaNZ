# TODO for AviaNZ

(1) Minor bugs and extensions

    SM: Tidy code, ensure comments, etc.

    NP: Make the oscillogram and spectrogram line up (basically, just sort out y-axis labels)
# Done

    SM: Enable removal of fill colour for spectrogram drag boxes
# Done

    NP: Make play sounds play the denoised version after denoising
# This seems to be complicated with undo etc. Still thinking whats the best way to do it,
  can easily add a separate button to play denoised but not nice. I fixed the plotting problem though.

    SM: Undo for segmentation
# Done

    SM: Save the amount of time the user makes the window show back into the config file
 # Done. Also for the various interface options

    SM: Add in the 'who the user is' annotation
    SM: Get the time from the file name (if standard) and use it to put day or night birds first

    NP: Read mp3 files
# SM: pysox

    SM: Make the arrows (on top-right) move on to next file if double clicked (and at start/end?)
# Done

    NP: Add a change directory option
# Don't want to change what's drawn there (currently selected file and its spectro), but effects thereafter
  when opening a new file

    SM (?): Make the boxes below the overview be clickable to get to that section
# Done
    NP: And stop the lines going too far to the right
# Done

    SM: Update the manual, correct the cheat sheet, get them included in the program (via web interface)

    NP: Make it possible to change parameters (look into pyqtgraph ParameterTree)

    ??: What to do with stereo sound? How about consistent sample rates?

    The updating of the colour of the overview seg has some colour weirdness -- gets darker. Some sort of overlapping? Not a major problem.
# Done

	NP: Add play button to check segment, picture alone is not enough to confirm. Make the pictures (check segment 1) small.

	NP: Stop loading the file when choose to cancel the progress bar
# Removed the cancel button for now. otherwise have to unroll what happened inside the loadFile when the user cancel it.

	File list dock becomes frozen - one was experiencing this. Had to restart the program.
	    # Can we reproduce it?
 
	Control marking the same segments again and again - multiple clicks on Find matches with the same pattern.
	# Thing to do is probably move find matches into the segmentations
	
	Interface --> Change spectrogram parameters --> add visible frequency range e.g. from:0 to:8000

	Update the status bar when auto saving the annotation? Users want to know/confirm.

	
(2) Memory management
    NP: It's a pain, but needs thinking about and then doing
    Could just split the file into shorter pieces? 
    Split files into 5 minute segments or whatever or look into paging

(3) Denoising, Wavelets and Segmentation
    Make denoising work
        Is there something wrong? No
        How long should a denoise piece be? Depends
	(1) Compare with matlab for long files: Almost similar results
	(2) Compare with making wavelet trees on shorter pieces
	(3) Denoise the segments separately
    
    NP: Stop the segmentation being based on 1s
# Done
    NP: Fully integrate wavelet seg into program
    NP: We actually want Kiwi (M) and Kiwi (F), and need to get all the ruru calls
    NP: Want to have some form of machine learning
		(1) decision tree
		(2) MLP
		(3) SVM
		(4) boosting
    SM: And need to think about the 95% confidence thing a lot more
    SM: Add in the Check Segments 2 bit for this, and actually process the results!

    SM: Make the segmentations work fully
        Get the minimum time of a segment parameter sorted
        Work out how to combine the methods, particularly, spot overlaps in segments and combine them
        Work out parameters and how to set them
        Remove cross-correlation? Or just improve?

    Both: Think about nice ways to train a new wavelet filter
		And get the whole workflow sorted for it

    Use intensity of colour to encode certainty?

(4) Features
    Use the wavelets
    Finish the Raven features
    Add MFCC (nearly done)
    And whatever else seems interesting

    More on fundamental frequency
        smoothing?
        harvest or bana (yaapt was awful)
    Shape metrics

(5) Learning
    Standard methods
        MLP
        Decision tree
        Boosting
        SVM
    LSTM or GRU

    HMM to string syllables together

(6) Other
    Think more about the spectrogram inversion
        If it works --> Stu's bats
        Denoise the spectrogram fully (median filter, smoothing, consider grab-cut)

    Any necessary database or metadata things?

    Bats do keep on coming up...

    Generative noise model
