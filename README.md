Welcome to AviaNZ, an open-source project for manual and automatic analysis of bio-acoustic recordings.

This software enables you to: 
* review and listen to wav files from acoustic field recorders, 
* segment and annotate the recordings, 
* train filters to recognise calls from particular species, 
* use filters that others have provided to batch process many files
* review annotations
* produce output in spreadsheet form, or as files ready for further statistical analyses

For more information about the project, see http://www.avianz.net
